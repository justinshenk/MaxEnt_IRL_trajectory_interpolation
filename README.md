# Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Trajectory Interpolation


![under construction](fig/underconstruction.jpg)


This repository contains example codes of trajectory interpolation method on the basis of maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning.



## Execution environment
- Language: Python (2.7.\*)
- Modules: Numpy, OpenCV


## Note
- The program requires a relatively higher performance computer to process in realistic computational time. The training takes approximately 3~4 days with 32 multi-thread processing and 256 GB memory.
